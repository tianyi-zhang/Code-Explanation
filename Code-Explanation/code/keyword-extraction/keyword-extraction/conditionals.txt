I was all in favour of throwing IllegalArgumentException for null parameters, until today, when I noticed the java.util.Objects.requireNonNull method in Java 7If a second thread were to continually reset the value of i to 0 (by calling slow.setI( 0 ), for example), the Slow class could never end its loopNote: (-r >> (Integer.SIZE - 1)) consists of the sign bit of r, repeated 32 times (thanks to sign extension of the >> operator.) This evaluates to 0 if r is zero or negative, -1 if r is positiveSo subtracting it from q has the effect of adding 1 if records % recordsPerPage > 0.Updated If you just want the object itself (instead of invoking members), then Outer.this is the way to go.BigInteger provides a constructor to generate a random number, uniformly distributed over the range 0 to (2^numBits - 1)If I read the spec correctly the automatic serialVersionUID shouldn't change if you change the value of a static of transient fieldSo, if you change the static initialization you would expect the serialVersionUID to change because you can't get the same object back again.Call DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate, and be sure to specify the desired/expected Locale rather than rely on the JVMâ€™s current default which can change at any moment during runtime(!).You can either specify your own formatting pattern or let java.time automatically localize as appropriate to a Locale specifying a human language for translation and cultural norms for deciding issues such as period versus comma.If you want to iterate through the map in the order that the elements were added, use LinkedHashMap as opposed to just Map.If you're an Android developer, you can use a utility class android.webkit.MimeTypeMap which maps MIME-types to file extensions and vice versa.For example, if you got its keySet and tried to remove an element from it, an exception would be raisedUsing an extension of UnicastRemoteObject gave us the ability to specify the client and server socket factories that we wanted to useIf you are using FireFox, install TamperData and change your accept header to application/json to see the JSON output.setAcceptor(TabAcceptor a_acceptor) should let the consumer code decide whether to let one tab transfer from one tabbed pane to anotherAre you trying to write the contents of a Reader to an OutputStream? If so, you'll have an easier time wrapping the OutputStream in an OutputStreamWriter and write the chars from the Reader to the Writer, instead of trying to convert the reader to an InputStream:The process by which enum constants are serialized cannot be customized: any class-specific writeObject, readObject, readObjectNoData, writeReplace, and readResolve methods defined by enum types are ignored during serialization and deserializationYes this is our very same hero :) Since the line private static final Foo INSTANCE = new Foo(); is only executed when the class FooLoader is actually used, this takes care of the lazy instantiation,A system property 'sun.awt.exception.handler' needs to be registerd with the Fully Qualified Class Name of a class with a zero argument constructorOn a side note if you have a situation where multiple threads update a common sum you can have a look at LongAdder class.Under high contention, expected throughput of this class is significantly higher than AtomicLong, at the expense of higher space consumption.The method computeIfAbsent checks if the specified key is already associated with a value or not? If no associated value then it attempts to compute its value using the given mapping functionYou can use a utility class Manifests from jcabi-manifests that automates finding and parsing of all MANIFEST.MF files available in classpathEach iteration checks to see if the substring of the container string is equalsIgnoreCase to the sub.It checks if 2 String regions match, but what's important is that it also has an overload with a handy ignoreCase parameter.My method is 4x faster compared to lowercasing and using contains(), 10x faster compared to using regular expressions and also 3x faster even if the Pattern is pre-cached (and losing flexibility of checking for an arbitrary substring).For each window, use JComponent.registerKeyboardAction with a condition of WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOWNote: This has changed significantly in June 2012 - the previous code could never work: an internal HashMap is required to lookup the values without creating an infinite loop between the TreeMap.get() -> compare() and compare() -> get()Then it is simply a matter of shifting the panel location in the scroll pane by the same amount in the opposite direction to put p back under the mouse cursor.You can use TypedQuery just as you did it with Query with that small difference that all operations are type safe now.Say you want to have a function passed in with a String param that returns an int. First you have to define an interface with the function as its only member, if you can't reuse an existing one.When working with the PixelGrabber, don't forget to extract the RGBA info from the pixel array before calling getImageFromArrayand SpringBean is declared within main context, it will have main context injected; otherwise, if it's declared within MVC context, it will have MVC context injected.As others have noted, if you are depending on strong randomness where every sublist is possible (and unbiased), you'll definitely need something stronger than java.util.RandomThe isConnected method won't help, it will return true even if the remote side has closed the socketHowever if you do want to round the double value and get a double value result, you can use org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision.round(..) as mentioned aboveNow If add another case statement and do not set name the compiler will failWith this listenerSet to register a new listener you just have to add it to the set, and even if it is not removed explicitly, if the listener is no longer referenced, it will be removed automatically by the JVM.If the manager stores your listener with a WeakReference, that means you don't need to remove the register e.gThis is much better than @Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class) because the test will fail if IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown before foo.doStuff()If you can use JUnit 4.7, you can use the ExpectedException RuleIt's an inner type, which emulates an ArrayList but actually directly references the passed array and makes it "write through" (modifications are reflected in the array).It forbids modifications through some of the List API's methods by way of simply extending an AbstractList (so, adding or removing elements is unsupported), however it allows calls to set() to override elementsThus this list isn't truly immutable and a call to asList() should be wrapped with Collections.unmodifiableList().Use the JDK's Arrays class and its asList() factory method, wrapped with a Collections.unmodifiableList():If you execute this class, c.close() will be executed when the try block is left, and before the catch and finally blocks are executedIf a matching A was found it will be removed and then you add the new one, you don't even need the if (set.contains(A)) conditional.The extraction of ApplicationData object has to be run in different thread ;)As mentioned before, EventSupport could preform some initial checks when the events listeners are registered.(The with reference only access is very useful.) If you use protected instead of private for the accessors/references, sub-classes of Foo can even return extended references from getReference[EDIT: as commented below I no longer remember my reasoning for this sentence and it is likely wrong: "Note that this will only work in abstract classes, first of all."] The next difficulty is that g() only works from DIRECT subclasses of ABut what if the fr.close() then causes another exception to be thrown? This will "trump" the first exception (a bit like putting return in a finally block) and you will lose all information about what actually caused the problem to begin with.If you simply use org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector, then you will not get continuation support.If it needs to be unique per PC: you could probably use (System.currentTimeMillis() << 4) | (staticCounter++ & 15) or something like that.When creating a new Date with the default constructor, it will represent the date and time the Formatter processes the LogRecord, not the date that the LogRecord was created.If this is your concern, and you are ruling static content out, simply modify your Servlet doGet/doPost method to cache the RSS content that you would otherwise return, so that handling each request does not mean re-fetching all of the data all over again.I think what you mean to say is that if you have a doGet/doPost method which contains code to build the data needed for the RSS feed from scratch, then each request triggers this fetching of data over and over again.With multiple bounds, only the left-most bound is considered for the erasure, so if max is given the following signature:This means if you use telnet to test, each keystroke will make the loop iterate once, hence, we simply concatenate char by char in a StringBuffer until char 13 is received.if you remove ds.last() than it will show all values of id columnThis is precisely the conversion you are trying to do when calling service.getList(callBack), and since the subtype relation does not hold, the conversion fails.If really necessary you can use the same construction to convert a Set back into a List.Note: If we want to maintain the insertion order then we need to use LinkedHashSet in place of HashSet.If you're using Java 1.5 (or higher) you should consider replacing StringBuffer with StringBuilder (if you're still using Java 1.4 you should consider a change of employer instead).If you meant a date-time, then use the Instant class to get a moment on the timeline in UTCArrays.sort only accepts a Comparator when being passed an Object[]If you attempt to dereference num BEFORE creating the object you get a NullPointerExceptionThis particular NPE can be avoided if the comparison order is reversed; namely, use .equals on a guaranteed non-null object.We can see that the program stops throwing the exception when s.length() is removed from the method.Where does bar come from? It is a parameter to the test method call, and if we look at how test was called, we can see that it comes from the foo static variableIn fact there is only one way: it can only happen if foo has the value nullNote that Iterator.remove is the only safe way to modify a collection during iteration; the behavior is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified in any other way while the iteration is in progress.It results in modCount getting different from expectedModCount, resulting in the exception ConcurrentModificationException.the best way is to use the remove method of the iterator object, I would go into the specifics of the place where the error "java.util.ConcurrentModificationException" is thrown.The call to Predicates.cast() is necessary here because a default removeIf method was added on the java.util.Collection interface in Java 8.With Eclipse Collections (formerly GS Collections), the method removeIf defined on MutableCollection will work:With Java 8 you can use the new removeIf methodIn case ArrayList:remove(int index)- if(index is last element's position) it avoids without System.arraycopy() and takes not time for this.The code below also informs if the informed date/time is in future (variable schedulable).You can get the cellID (The id of the phone pole that the mobile is connected to) on a lot of phones thru System.getProperty(String arg) Here i have an example that tries a few keys to see if a cellID can be foundThe confusing part here is that Calendar.getTime() returns you a Date in your current timezone, and also that there is no method to modify the timezone of a calendar and have the underlying date rolled alsoYou might want to look into either creating a class that implements the HttpSession interface yourself for the purposes of unit testing only (a stub), and running your tests off of that, or you should take a look at dwnLoadCel and determine if it really needs to have a reference to the HttpSession, or if it just needs some properties within the HttpSessionYour second approach is almost right (FreeMarkerViewResolver), but if I remember correctly I also had to extend from FreeMarkerView and TilesView to explicitly bridge both models together.Similarly, you can validate if a String is a float or a double but in those cases you have to encounter only one . (dot) in the String and of course check if digits == (aString.length()-1)If you express time as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT (which is how the Date object stores it's date/time), then these date/times are equal, it's just the TimeZone that is different.Basically, when you call executeUpdate() or executeQuery(), use the Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS constantAlthough not significant, setting the StringBuilder's initial buffer size will give a small gain.Smaller issue is that is uses a delegate when it could just expand the MultipartEntityFrom the other answers you can just override the AbstractHttpEntity class children or implementations public void writeTo(OutputStream outstream) method you are using if do not want to create a class.If you just want to use AWT, then use Graphics.getFontMetrics (optionally specifying the font, for a non-default one) to get a FontMetrics and then FontMetrics.stringWidth to find the width for the specified string.If I understood your problem correctly, MyMDB listens to a topic on WebLogic, and you want to use an additional JMS destination provided by JBoss, defined in a deployed configuration file and identified by its JNDI name (by default, deploy/jms/jms-ds.xml only contains the configuration for the JMS provider and connection factories -- no data sources).Warning: String.replaceAll() function does not modify the String on which it is appliedThe code written inside a Threads run() method will execute when the runtime object terminates...an elapsed amount of time, with no reference to a calendar system) then you should probably be using Duration for the most part - you can then call toPeriod (specifying whatever PeriodType you want to reflect whether 25 hours becomes 1 day and 1 hour or not, etc) to get a Period which you can format.If you're using Java 8 or later: I'd normally suggest using java.time.Duration to represent the durationIt's actually rare for me to use the idiom "if (object != null && ...".Method validate() will throw checked ValidationException if any of the parameters is null (checked or unchecked is more a design/taste issue, but my ValidationException is checked).If you only need this for writing an InputStream to a File then you can use this simple function:If your reason for iterating trough the Map, is to do an operation on the value and write to a resulting MapIt is a bit tricky, but it works, if you are limited to return a List interface, so anyone after you can implement your list whenever he wants.So if your JS file is for example located at WebContent/js/file.js then you can use the following in your Servlet to get a File handle of it:Difference between Pattern.quote and Matcher.quoteReplacement was not clear to me before I saw following exampleI don't know how efficient it is but the below code works as well.You need to define a BiFunction at the beginningYou can make use of computeIfAbsent method in Map interface provided in Java 8.I have to admit that the column names don't appear when using the above examples (I usually use the DefaultTableModel's setDataVector method), so if anyone has any suggestions on how to make the column names appear, please do :)I would use Google Collections Guava to do this - if your values are Comparable then you can useIf you're using DecimalFormat to convert double to String, it's very straightforward:A few characters would be saved, if this could be just a ListIf we see the Definition of Arrays.asList() method you will got something like thisThere might be another answer for this too If you see declaration for java.util.Collections.addAll() method.This works if A is given a concrete type by a subclass:The difference will be that the body of getList will be constrained with how it can use the callbackAssume that we have 3 classes; Grandfather, Father and Son:If I do revisit this in the future, I'll probably work on extending ConcurrentHashMap in the same way LinkedHashMap extends HashMap.Here's the output if I pass the current time ("12:09:05 EDT" from Calendar.getInstance()) in:You might want to think carefully about the generics in the performMonitor call though - what's the return value meant to signify?If map is a Map<K, Collection<V>>, use the idiom computeIfAbsent(...).add(...), like this:For example, if you have a Graphics variable called g, you'd use:As you can see, the only difference is all the redundant casts to Object.There is alternative solution, if you can afford to change the body of Settings class:I've written some custom code to find my RollingFileAppender (which is unnecessarily difficult to get access to in log4j!) which I then cause to roll over
