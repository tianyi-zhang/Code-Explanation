After you have added the Maps to your imports, you can use Maps.transformValues and Maps.transformEntries on your maps, like this:After looking through the implementation of the store method, I found that it relies upon entrySetSeems like DateFormat.getTimeZone() returns the same TimeZone before and after the parse()..Insert a boolean flag isFinished and set it to true at the end of your loop and to false before the loopThese may be applied to a TreeMap (as Ordering extends Comparator), or a LinkedHashMap after some sortingAfterwards the proxy settings are available to Java API via java.net.ProxySelector.When working with the PixelGrabber, don't forget to extract the RGBA info from the pixel array before calling getImageFromArraySince you are starting with a String, you need to covert to a DOM object (e.g. Node) before you can use the Transformer.And as @Recurse noted (but apparently -1 me) you can do the preceding with out making String name final to get the compiler error (which I never said you couldn't) but you could easily make the compiler error go away setting name after the switch statement which throws away the expression semantics or worse forgetting to break which you cannot cause an error (despite what @Recurse says) without using final:This is much better than @Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class) because the test will fail if IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown before foo.doStuff()If you execute this class, c.close() will be executed when the try block is left, and before the catch and finally blocks are executedI ended up subclassing Struts' ServletRedirectResult and overriding it's doExecute() method to do my logic before calling super.doExecute()As mentioned before, EventSupport could preform some initial checks when the events listeners are registered.If you attempt to dereference num BEFORE creating the object you get a NullPointerExceptionThis is enough to give us a solution: add a call to printer.setName() before calling printer.print().It is a bit tricky, but it works, if you are limited to return a List interface, so anyone after you can implement your list whenever he wants.Difference between Pattern.quote and Matcher.quoteReplacement was not clear to me before I saw following exampleWhich is equal to the signature of max before Generics.in which case you are not creating the object obj, rather assuming that is was created before the doSomething method was called
